This is COLLAB!
A blog for musicians and music lovers 

“Collab” is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) Blog Website/Application enabling artists and producers to share their song ideas and collaborate to create new songs. The platform will be open if you have an account, allowing users to create blog posts that include song help, inspirational posts, and music reviews/discussions and exchange messages seamlessly. In the real world, the end-user is the aspiring musician or producer who needs inspiration and help to finish the song of tomorrow and has a serious case of writer’s block.

The programming languages utilized for this project include PHP, HTML, and CSS on the Visual Studio platform. Additionally, MySQL/XAMPP has been employed to develop a comprehensive database schema that will efficiently manage the users, blog posts, and post categories. 

Thank you,
