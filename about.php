    “Collab” is a Blog Website/Application that will enable artists and producers 
    to share their song ideas and collaborate to create new songs. The platform will 
    be open if you have an account, allowing users to create blog posts that include 
    song help, inspirational posts, and music reviews/discussions and exchange messages 
    seamlessly. In the real world, the end-user is the aspiring musician or producer that 
    needs inspiration, help finishing the song of tomorrow, and has the serious case of writer's block.
